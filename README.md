# RetroQoL-theme-Funkey-RGNano

Theme for devices with 240x240 screen running the FunkeyOS firmware.
These currently include the original Funkey S, and the clones Powkiddy Q36 and Anbernic RG Nano.

> Based off the theme "Retro Room" by r3n0. (thank you so much!!!) <

This version (QoL) edited by berickphilip.
The two reasons/goals for creating this version were Quality of Life improvements:
- Make everything easier to see on the tiny screen.
- Make everything faster/snappier to browse.

Four colour variations available (default, purple, blue, red).
Feel free to use whichever best matches your device!

----->> To install/use:

1 - Browse to the folder \FunKey\.retrofe\layouts inside your device or its SD Card.
Currently, for the Funkey S the way to do this is to connect it to a PC with the USB cable and, in the device itself, go to the menu option "Mount USB".
For the RG Nano, you can use the same method as above OR you can directly remove the SD Card from the Nano and load it into your PC.
For the Powkiddy Q36 I have no idea, sorry.. but should be similar to the two other devices mentioned.

2 - Download and unzip one theme variation (default, purple, blue or red).
There will be a folder inside it. Extract it to the folder mentioned above in step 1.
So, the resulting should look similar to this: \FunKey\.retrofe\layouts\RetroQoL_purple

3 - inside the \FunKey\.retrofe\layouts folder, there should be a file called "layouts.list".
It is just a simple text file. Inside it there is a list of the themes (folder names) that should be available(visible) to your device.
Edit this file in a simple text editor and add the name for the folder of the theme that you added.
For example: if you added the folder "RetroQoL_purple", then in the text file you need to add a new line at the end and write the exact same name in it, in this case, RetroQoL_purple

4 - After unmounting the device or SD card from your PC, start your device as usual. The new theme should now be in the themes list.

Enjoy!
